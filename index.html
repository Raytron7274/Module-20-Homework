            <p>
                We used responsive web design techniques and modern design elements to create a more user friendly
                version of the NAMI MN website.

        <div class="problem">
            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>The website for NAMI MN has a very poor information architecture, unappealing style, and the components
                of the site don’t resize well. Users find it hard to find what they need and feel like the site is
                unwelcoming.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="solution">
            <h3>The Solution</h3>
            <p>We used modern UX/UI design techniques to create an easy to use site that feels welcoming, is usable on
                any device, and most importantly allows the user to get the help they need.

    <h2 style="display: flex; justify-content: center;" class="margin20">Project Research</h2>
    <div class="persona">
        <h3>User Persona</h3>
        <p>To start off the research the whole team got together to create a user persona to help predict what kind of
            user would be visiting the website. The user we came up with is Corey Lynch; a graphic design student who is
            struggling to balance their work, school, and social life. After we finalized our user persona we made an 
            interview plan and script alongside a survey for people who weren't available for a full interview.

        <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
        <p>We ended up with lots of data that pointed to a poor website layout and navigation structure. Because of that
            I wanted to do a competitor analysis on a few other NAMI websites to see how they present similar
            information. The sites I looked at were the North Dakota and Wisconsin versions of the site which put more
            important mental health resources front and center on the home page.

        <div class="cardSort margin20">
            <div style="margin-right: 20px;">
                <h3>Card Sorting Activity</h3>
                <p>I also did a full navigation analysis which included the primary nav and the layout of the site.
                    After the analysis I created a card sorting activity so I could see how people would naturally sort
                    the content in the site.

                <h3>Site Mapping</h3>
                <p>Using the results of both the interviews and card sorting activity I created a sight map. My goal was
                    to create an information structure that allowed the user to get support as fast as possible.

        <div class="wireframing margin20">
            <h3>Wireframing and Prototyping</h3>
            <p>Once the team and I reviewed and iterated the site map it was time to create wireframes and prototypes
                for testing. I was in charge of building components for this part and since we were in the lo-fi phase I
                focused on the primary navigation. We decided on a standard click-to-open drop down menu instead of the
                hover menu since it’s easier to use.

        <div class="nav margin20">
            <h3>Navigation</h3>
            <p>Since there were a lot of different tabs in some of the drop downs I created 2 columns to help make it
                easier to scan through.
            </p>

        <div class="mobileNav margin20">
            <p>For mobile I made a simple accordion menu to help compress all of the content to make it easier to scroll
                through.</p>

        <div class="userTests margin20">
            <h3>User Tests</h3>
            <p>After we finished the lo-fi prototype it was time for user tests. The first round of testers didn’t have
                too many issues with completing the task but also felt like the content on the page was crowded. This
                also helped us see what does and doesn’t work in terms of labeling buttons and icons.

        <div class="styleGuide margin20">
            <h3>Style Guide</h3>
            <p>Around that same time Sunayana had finished our style guide so the group looked it over. We wanted to
                make the site feel like it was there to help and that the user would be taken care of. After a few color
                and font tweaks we ended on a final version so it was time to start on the hi-fi version of our site.

    <h2>Final Site</h2>
    <section class="finalSite">
        <h3>Hi-Fi Prototype</h3>
        <p>For the hi-fi version I was in charge of the desktop layout. I took a lot of inspiration from the other NAMI
            websites like adding a support group and get involved section. But I also added some new elements as well
            like the navigation cards Jonas built that would take you to the most vital parts of the site. Or the image
            carousel which was added to make the user feel more comfortable and welcome.

        <h3>Final Prototype</h3>
        <p>After about 8 user tests conducted by all of the members of the team I created a new iteration of the site.
            Test users felt that the site was cluttered and some of the buttons were hard to read. A big change was the
            text layout on the final page; I reorganized the content to be easier to scan through.

    <section class="finalThoughts">
        <h2>Optimizing Our Process</h2>
        <p>Throughout the project we did a handful of tasks that weren’t exactly valuable to us. We did them just to
            check a box or meet a requirement. Instead, we should have looked into why a certain design or research
            process is beneficial over others. Sometimes not everything applies to your specific needs. An example in
            our case would be the I like, I wish, and I wonder matrix; we got plenty of data that was more in depth and
            specific form our interviews and survey.
        </p>
        <h2>Optimizing Our Workspace</h2>
        <p>At the end of the project I went through and renamed, reformatted, and organized our figma board. This made
            it way easier to find specific components, wireframes, and prototypes. Once I was done I thought to myself,
            ”probably should have done this throughout the project”. It’s a simple thing but makes a huge difference in
            workflow and coordination.
        </p>
        <h2>Creating a Base Template</h2>
        <p>When I was working on the hi-fi version of the site I had to recreate many wireframes and groups because I
            didn’t create a base layout for each webpage. For my next projects I’d like to have a base design for each
            site that I can add components, menus, and other assets into without remaking things like a header and
            footer.
