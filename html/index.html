            <p>
                We used responsive web design techniques and modern design elements to create a more user friendly
                version of the NAMI MN website.

        <div class="problem">
            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>The website for NAMI MN has a very poor information architecture, unappealing style, and the components of the site don’t resize well. Users find it hard to find what they need and feel like the site is unwelcoming.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="solution">
            <h3>The Solution</h3>
            <p>We used modern UX/UI design techniques to create an easy to use site that feels welcoming, is usable on any device, and most importantly allows the user to get the help they need.

    <h2 style="display: flex; justify-content: center;" class="margin20">Project Research</h2>
    <div class="persona">
        <h3>User Persona</h3>
        <p>To start off the research the whole team got together to create a user persona to help predict what kind of user would be visiting the website. The user we came up with is Corey Lynch; a graphic design student who is struggling to balance their work, school, and social life. After we finalized our user persona we made an  interview plan and script alongside a survey for people who weren't available for a full interview.

        <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
        <p>We ended up with lots of data that pointed to a poor website layout and navigation structure. Because of that I wanted to do a competitor analysis on a few other NAMI websites to see how they present similar information. The sites I looked at were the North Dakota and Wisconsin versions of the site which put more important mental health resources front and center on the home page.

        <div class="cardSort margin20">
            <div style="margin-right: 20px;">
                <h3>Card Sorting Activity</h3> <p>I also did a full navigation analysis which included the primary nav and the layout of the site. After the analysis I created a card sorting activity so I could see how people would naturally sort the content in the site.

            <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
                <h3>Site Mapping</h3>
                <p>Using the results of both the interviews and card sorting activity I created a sight map. My goal was to create an information structure that allowed the user to get support as fast as possible.

        <div class="wireframing margin20">
            <h3>Wireframing and Prototyping</h3>
            <p>Once the team and I reviewed and iterated the site map it was time to create wireframes and prototypes for testing. I was in charge of building components for this part and since we were in the lo-fi phase I focused on the primary navigation. We decided on a standard click-to-open drop down menu instead of the hover menu since it’s easier to use.
